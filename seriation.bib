abstract = {During the past 10 years, about 150 scientists in 25 countries have collaborated under the auspices of the International Geological Correlation Programme Project No. 148: Evaluation and Development of Quantitative Stratigraphical Correlation Techniques. This paper reviews mathematical methods of stratigraphical correlation, mainly in biostratigraphy but also in chronostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy. Sequencing methods treat the relative order of stratigraphic events such as the highest occurrences of fossil taxa as observed in many sections. Intervals between successive events in an ordered sequence can be estimated and the results expressed in linear time if a subgroup of the stratigraphical events can be dated. Recently such methods have been used to develop a new deep-water benthic foraminiferal zonation for the Cenozoic strata of the Central and Viking Grabens, North Sea. Several regional hiatuses of 2 to 5 m.y. in duration, can be recognized and matched to changes in sea level. The same methods have been used for automated isochron contouring with error bars in depth or time units in Cenozoic and Cretaceous basins, off eastern Canada. Such information may be used for automated basin history analysis. Time-successive assemblages of fossils can be established by using multivariate methods applied to co-occurrences of events or by the method of unitary associations in conjunction with graph-theory on the overlap of stratigraphical ranges. Other methods for stratigraphical correlation reviewed in this paper include the composite standard method and estimation of the age of chronostratigraphical boundaries using maximum likelihood and cubic spline interpolations. Attractions of quantitative stratigraphy are the use of rigorous methodology which highlights many properties of the data, the ability to handle large and complex data bases in an objective manner, and statistical evaluation of the uncertainty in the results. Generally, little conceptual orientation is required in order to use these methods and thereby gain more information from a particular dataset.},

Recently, genetic algorithms using standard crossover and mutation operators have been proposed to tackle this problem. In this paper, we carry out an experimental study that adds to this genetic algorithm crossover and mutation operators specially designed to deal with permutations and includes other parameters (initialization, replacement policy, mutation and crossover rates and stopping criteria) not examined in previous works. A proper analysis of the results must take into account all the parameters simultaneously, since the wrong conclusions can be drawn by studying each separately from the others. This is why we propose a framework for a multidimensional analysis of the results. This includes multiple hypothesis testing and a regression tree that builds a parsimonious and predictive model of the suitable configurations of the parameters.}

abstract = {Seriation of an original data matrix provides the paleoecologist with a simple and powerful tool for data manipulation. The data matrix lists the presences and absences of taxa in samples. The strategy is to generate a unidimensional sequence by rearranging the taxa and samples so that the presences are blocked along the matrix diagonal. The method is illustrated with two case studies from the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group of New York. The first represents a regressive interval and the seriation sequence summarizes the changes in fauna and samples which can be explained by falling sea level. The second example embraces a much wider range of variation. Seriation mainly recovers a first-order pattern related to depth and correlated variables. This seriation does not reveal parameters such as the nature of the substrate, turbidity, habitat stability and distance offshore. These data cannot be reduced to one dimension. In all cases, seriation yields results similar to those of cluster analysis and the first axis of multivariate ordinations frequently used by ecologists and paleoecologists.

abstract = {Integer linear programming approaches for seriation of asymmetric n × n proximity matrices have generally been perceived as intractable for problems of practical size. However, to date, no computational evidence has been provided regarding the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of such approaches. This paper presents an evaluation of an integer linear programming method for asymmetric seriation using five moderately sized matrices (15 ≤ n ≤ 36) from the psychological literature, as well as 80 synthetic matrices (20 ≤ n ≤ 30). The solution to the linear programming relaxation of the integer-programming model was integer-optimal for each of the five empirical matrices and many of the synthetic matrices. In such instances, branch-and-bound integer programming was not required and optimal orderings were obtained within a few seconds. In all cases where the solution to the linear programming relaxation was not integer-optimal, branch-and-bound integer programming was able to find an optimal seriation in 18 minutes or less. A pragmatic solution strategy for larger matrices (n > 30) is also presented. This approach exploits the fact that, in many instances, only a modest percentage of all possible transitivity constraints are required to obtain an optimal solution.},

The seriation of the skew-symmetric component can emphasize information corresponding to the sign or absolute magnitude of the matrix elements, and the choice of objective criterion can have a profound impact on the ordering. In this research note, we propose a bicriterion approach for seriation of a skew-symmetric matrix incorporating both sign and magnitude information. Two numerical demonstrations reveal that the bicriterion procedure is an effective alternative to direct seriation of the skew-symmetric matrix, facilitating favourable trade-offs among sign and magnitude information.},

The key advantages of the proposed method are: (a) it can be used in conjunction with existing two-mode blockmodeling algorithms by facilitating selection of the number of classes for the rows and columns of the matrix and the appropriate types of ideal blocks; (b) the model uses a well-grounded index based on Robinson structure, (c) guaranteed optimal solutions can be obtained for problems of practical size, and (d) the seriation method is frequently capable of producing a solution that has a substantive interpretation with respect to the orderings of the row objects and column items.},

publisher={Springer-Verlag},
abstract={Dynamic programming methods for matrix permutation problems in combinatorial data analysis can produce globally-optimal solutions for matrices up to size 30×30, but are computationally infeasible for larger matrices because of enormous computer memory requirements. Branch-and-bound methods also guarantee globally-optimal solutions, but computation time considerations generally limit their applicability to matrix sizes no greater than 35×35. Accordingly, a variety of heuristic methods have been proposed for larger matrices, including iterative quadratic assignment, tabu search, simulated annealing, and variable neighborhood search. Although these heuristics can produce exceptional results, they are prone to converge to local optima where the permutation is difficult to dislodge via traditional neighborhood moves (e.g., pairwise interchanges, object-block relocations, object-block reversals, etc.). We show that a heuristic implementation of dynamic programming yields an efficient procedure for escaping local optima. Specifically, we propose applying dynamic programming to reasonably-sized subsequences of consecutive objects in the locally-optimal permutation, identified by simulated annealing, to further improve the value of the objective function. Experimental results are provided for three classic matrix permutation problems in the combinatorial data analysis literature: (a) maximizing a dominance index for an asymmetric proximity matrix; (b) least-squares unidimensional scaling of a symmetric dissimilarity matrix; and (c) approximating an anti-Robinson structure for a symmetric dissimilarity matrix.}

These problems encompass applications such as unidimensional scaling, paired-comparison ranking, and anti-Robinson forms. The importance of simultaneously incorporating multiple objective criteria in matrix permutation applications is well recognized in the literature; however, to date, there has been a reliance on weighted-sum approaches that transform the multiobjective problem into a single-objective optimization problem. Although exact solutions to these single-objective problems produce supported Pareto efficient solutions to the multiobjective problem, many interesting unsupported Pareto efficient solutions may be missed. We illustrate the limitation of the weighted-sum approach with an example from the psychological literature and devise an effective heuristic algorithm for estimating both the supported and unsupported solutions of the Pareto efficient set.},

A typical data set used in such studies can be reported as a cross-classification table (often called an abundance matrix or, equivalently, a contingency table) of excavated features against artefact types. Each entry of the table represents the number of a particular artefact type found in a particular archaeological feature. Methodologies for attempting to identify temporal sequences on the basis of such data are commonly referred to as seriation techniques. Several different procedures for seriation including both parametric and non-parametric statistics have been used in an attempt to reconstruct relative chronological orders on the basis of such contingency tables. We develop some possible model-based approaches that might be used to aid in relative, archaeological chronology building. We use the recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on Langevin diffusions to fit some of the models proposed. Predictive Bayesian model choice techniques are then employed to ascertain which of the models that we develop are most plausible. We analyse two data sets taken from the literature on archaeological seriation.},

abstract = {A new algorithm (DSA: Direct Seriation Algorithm) for the seriation (optimal re-ordering of the objects) is described. Seriation can be applied also to make easier the interpretation of the dendrograms obtained with many clustering techniques. The algorithm directly works on the similarity dendrogram, instead of the similarity matrix, by translation or rotation of the leaves of one or more branches of the dendrogram. \{DSA\} maximises an objective function, the sum of the similarities between objects adjacent on the abscissa of the dendrogram. The algorithm has been tested on some real and simulated data, from 11 to 300 objects about. In the case of unidimensional data, where the optimal order of the objects is known (the order of the variable) the algorithm always reaches rapidly the underlying order. },

abstract ={Environmental controls on the distribution of fossils most commonly are found by recognizing that certain distinctive fossil assemblages are associated with particular lithofacies. Lack of change in lithofacies commonly is used as indicating a lack of significant environmental effects on the stratigraphic distribution of fossils. The results presented here challenge that view. The Upper Ordovician Kope Formation of the Cincinnati, Ohio, area has long been considered a single unit, both lithostratigraphically and in terms of depositional environment. Gradient analysis of over 1000 fossil assemblages reveals subtle environmental control on the distribution of fossils, in the absence of obvious lithologic change. This gradient analysis is used to construct an ecological model of the Kope fauna, with values of preferred depth, depth tolerance, and peak abundance estimated for the most common fossils. This method, conducted within a single lithofacies, offers the potential for reconstructing sequence architecture because faunas can be more sensitive recorders of environment than lithofacies. In addition, the presence of subtle facies control as in the Kope raises the prospect that environmental controls on paleobiologic and biostratigraphic patterns may be more pervasive than generally acknowledged.},

In addition, correspondences with several hierarchical clustering techniques are presented as well as an extension to the newer circular-arc models developed in mathematics. A number of substantive examples are given incorporating data sets available in the psychological literature that have been analysed previously with alternative methods.},

abstract = {The quadratic assignment paradigm developed in operations research is discussed as a general approach to data analysis tasks characterized by the use of proximity matrices. Data analysis problems are first classified as being either static or non-static. The term ‘static’ implies the evaluation of a detailed substantive hypothesis that is posited without the aid of the actual data. Alternatively, the term ‘non-static’ suggests a search for a particular type of relational structure within the obtained proximity matrix and without the statement of a specific conjecture beforehand. Although the static class of problems is directly related to several inference procedures commonly used in classical statistics, the major emphasis in this paper is on applying a general computational heuristic to attack the non-static problem and in using the quadratic assignment orientation to discuss a variety of research tactics of importance in the behavioral sciences and, particularly, in psychology. An extensive set of numerical examples is given illustrating the application of the search procedure to hierarchical clustering, the identification of homogeneous object subsets, linear and circular seriation, and a discrete version of multidimensional scaling.},

Typically, the latter are obtained in some way from the original proximity measures. A variety of these indices, suggested by the recent literature on cluster analysis and seriation, are mentioned explicitly along with a discussion of an approximate permutation test for assessing their relative size. Finally, a representative application of two generalized cross-product statistics is presented in terms of a data analysis problem that requires the comparison of a partition of S against a proximity function denned on S × S.},

A well-known clustering technique, single linkage clustering, can be considered as an example of the seriation procedures (based actually on the minimum spanning tree construction) leading to the global maximum of a corresponding “minimum split” set function. The purpose of this work is to extend this property to the wide class of so-called monotone linkages. It is shown that the minimum split functions of monotone linkages can be maximized greedily. Moreover, this class of set functions is proven to coincide with the class of so-called quasi-concave set functions.},

This information can be summarized in the form of a matrix A of zeros (indicating absence) and ones (indicating presence), where each row of the matrix is associated with a tomb, and each column with a `variety'. A mathematical investigation suggests that much (perhaps all) of the information relevant to seriation is stored in the matrix product AA$^{\prime}$, and accordingly this similarity-matrix is taken as the starting-point of a multi-dimensional scaling procedure. Experiments with artificial data arising from a linear structure show that a two-dimensional output in the form of a horse-shoe is to be expected. If we then read off the labels of the points representing the graves, starting at one `vertex' of the horseshoe and working round it till the other is reached, we obtain an estimate of the serial order (or of the serial order reversed).},

The simplest specific example is the problem of 'seriation on the basis of incidence of types', several automated solutions for which are now available and work well. These yield provisional solutions which have to be carefully cleaned up by the archaeologist, but they have the advantage (over earlier 'hand' methods) that the degree to which subjective judgements are employed can be carefully controlled. A more formidable problem is that of reconstructing the geographical layout of a mediaeval manor from information derived from contemporary cartularies and later deeds. This, too, can be solved 'by hand', but recently it has become clear that automated solutions are also possible, as in the seriation problem, and again offer certain advantages.},

Some of the innovations consist of working with the whole matrix pattern from start to finish, more exhaustive row-column comparisons, provision for specifying different ordering criteria, consistent utilization of a chosen criterion for matrix evaluation as well as for row-column placement, and a means of lessening the effect of input-order bias. The program is designed to produce a close approximation of an ideal model in order to place data collections as accurately as possible on a continuum of similarity for purposes such as chronological ordering and the expression of intercultural relationships.},

The other problem, the seriation problem, is frequently encountered in archeology and has applications in genetics and in graph theory. Recent efforts to solve the seriation problem have produced numerous statistical and heuristic solutions. However algorithms that produce global optima remain very unsatisfactory. A new exact algorithm based on the interdependence between the travelling salesman problem and the seriation problem is presented here. It can handle larger problems than any of the existing exact algorithms.},

Seriation is an unsupervised data mining technique that reorders objects into a sequence along a one-dimensional continuum to make sense of the whole series. Clustering assigns objects to groups, whereas seriation assigns objects to a position within a sequence. Seriation has been applied to a variety of disciplines including archaeology and anthropology; cartography, graphics, and information visualization; sociology and sociometry; psychology and psychometrics; ecology; biology and bioinformatics; cellular manufacturing; and operations research. Interestingly, across those different disciplines, there are several commonly emerging similar structural patterns. Visual Matrix Explorer allows users to explore and link those patterns, share an online workplace and instantly transmit changes in the system to other users.},

The only drawback of this algorithm is its dependence on the initial partition.

abstract={In instance-based machine learning, algorithms often suffer from high storage requirements because of the large number of training instances. This can result not only in large computer memory usage and long response time, but also very often in oversensitivity to noise. To tackle such problems, various instance reduction algorithms have been developed that remove noisy and redundant patterns. In this work, we discuss the concept of data seriation and its application on instance-based learning, and introduce a new approach, the Instance Seriation for Prototype Abstraction algorithm (ISPA), which is a data condensation method that generates a new set of prototypes. ISPA is evaluated on 10 datasets and its performance is compared to other successfully established pruning algorithms. Our method exhibited competitive results in terms of classification accuracies and reduction rates.},

In this article, we outline a bootstrapped approach to correspondence analysis-based seriation designed to help assess and improve the stability of relative orderings produced through such analyses. This procedure systematically identifies and removes small samples and sites with unusual samples, such as those with multiple components, which are not handled well by seriation and require secondary interpretation. Our approach combines data from multiple projects in the Zuni region of the American Southwest in order to gauge the effects of intraregional variation in ceramic distributions and reexamine prior interpretations of demographic change based on individual projects. This analysis highlights two previously unknown regional trends, including variation in the distribution of multicomponent sites and potential short-term depopulation of a significant part of the region. Based on this example, we further suggest that our method may be particularly useful in situations where little prior chronological information is available. },

The parameters of the model are natural: the ordering of the sites, the origination and extinction times for each taxon, and the probabilities of different types of errors. We show that the posterior distributions of these parameters can be estimated reliably by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The posterior distributions of the model parameters can be used to answer many different questions about the data, including seriation (finding the best ordering of the sites) and outlier detection. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model and estimation method on synthetic data and on real data on large late Cenozoic mammals. As an example, for the sites with large number of occurrences of common genera, our methods give orderings, whose correlation with geochronologic ages is 0.95.},

year={1992},
abstract={A number of model-based scaling methods have been developed that apply to asymmetric proximity matrices. A flexible data analysis approach is pro posed that combines two psychometric procedures— seriation and multidimensional scaling (MDS). The method uses seriation to define an empirical order ing of the stimuli, and then uses MDS to scale the two separate triangles of the proximity matrix defined by this ordering. The MDS solution con tains directed distances, which define an "extra" dimension that would not otherwise be portrayed, because the dimension comes from relations between the two triangles rather than within triangles. The method is particularly appropriate for the analysis of proximities containing temporal information. A major difficulty is the computa tional intensity of existing seriation algorithms, which is handled by defining a nonmetric seriation algorithm that requires only one complete itera tion. The procedure is illustrated using a matrix of co-citations between recent presidents of the Psychometric Society.},

abstract = {An interval digraph is the intersection digraph of a family of ordered pairs of intervals on the real line; the family is an interval representation of the digraph. It is well known that an interval digraph has many representations that differ in the order of the endpoints of the intervals on the line. This paper generalizes the corresponding results on interval graphs by Skrien [Chronological orderings of interval graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. 8 (1984) 69–83] and describes how, given an interval digraph, the order of intervals of one representation differs from another.},

abstract = {If an undirected graph is the intersection graph of a set of intervals of the real line, it is called an interval graph and the set of intervals is called an interval representation of the graph. An interval graph typically has many representations that differ in the order of the endpoints of the intervals along the line. This paper gives three methods for describing these differences and shows how these methods can be used to determine whether a graph has a representation satisfying various restrictions on the relative positions of the intervals. It concludes with an application of these results to the subject of interval counts of interval graphs.},

abstract = {One of the many areas in which correspondence analysis (CA) is an effective method, concerns seriation problems. For example, \{CA\} is a well-known technique for the seriation of archaeological assemblages. A problem with the \{CA\} seriation solution, however, is that only a relative ordering of the assemblages is obtained. To improve the usual \{CA\} solution, a constrained \{CA\} approach that incorporates additional information in the form of equality and inequality constraints concerning the time points of the assemblages may be considered. Using such constraints, explicit dates can be assigned to the seriation solution. The set of constraints that can be used in \{CA\} by introducing interval constraints is extended. That is, constraints that put the CA solution within a specific time frame. Moreover, the quality of the constrained \{CA\} solution is studied in a simulation study. In particular, by means of the simulation study we are able to assess how well ordinary, and constrained \{CA\} can recover the true time order. Furthermore, for the constrained approach, it is shown that the true dates are retrieved satisfactory. The simulation study is set up in such a way that it mimics the data of a series of ceramic assemblages consisting of the locally produced tableware from Sagalassos (SW Turkey). It is found that the dating of the assemblages on the basis of constraints appears to work quite well.},

abstract ={Summary: PermutMatrix is a work space designed to graphically explore gene expression data. It relies on the graphical approach introduced by Eisen and also offers several methods for the optimal reorganization of rows and columns of a numerical dataset. For example, several methods are proposed for optimal reorganization of the leaves of a hierarchical clustering tree, along with several seriation or unidimensional scaling methods that do not require any preliminary hierarchical clustering. This program, developed for MS Windows, with MS-Visual C++, has a clear and efficient graphical interface. Large datasets can be thoroughly and quickly analyzed.Availability: http://www.lirmm.fr/~caraux/PermutMatrix/Contact: caraux@lirmm.fr},

abstract = {Abstract Two-way seriation is a popular technique to analyze groups of similar instances and their features, as well as the connections between the groups themselves. The two-way seriated data may be visualized as a two-dimensional heat map or as a three-dimensional landscape where colour codes or height correspond to the values in the matrix. To achieve a meaningful visualization of high-dimensional data, a compactly supported convolution kernel is introduced, which is similar to filter kernels used in image reconstruction and geostatistics. This filter populates the high-dimensional space with values that interpolate nearby elements and provides insight into the clustering structure. Ordinary two-way seriation is also extended to deal with updates of both the row and column spaces. Combined with the convolution kernel, a three-dimensional visualization of dynamics is demonstrated on two datasets, a news collection and a set of microarray measurements. },
